4333181 was Jakobud, 4 years, 7 months ago, message: In the call() method, the exception wasn't being thrown if only 1 or more than 2 arguments were passed to the method. Fixed conditional statement to only accept exactly 2 arguments. In the route() method, URI::current() was evaluating as '/' in all situations. It was never evaluating as the route that you specified when executing the command. This could be part of a larger underlying bug with Symfony's HttpFoundation\Request class. It might be a band-aid fix, but replacing URI::current() with $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] allows the method to run the correct route. These fixes uncovered what I believe is potentially another bug. When var_dump($route->response()) is run, "NULL" and a newline is appended to the output. It's something to do with var_dump(), as echo $route->response() echo's the correct output without the extra "NULL".
